 - Step 5 - What happens next, when the sample is submitted



## Step 1 - Signing the CLA (One-time activity)

Before we can accept your pull requests you will be asked to sign electronically Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which is a pre-requisite for any contributions all PnP repositories. This will be one-time process, so for any future contributions you will not be asked to re-sign anything. After the CLA has been signed, our PnP core team members will have a look at your submission for a final verification of the submission. **Please do not delete your development branch until the submission has been closed.**

You can find Microsoft CLA from the following address - https://cla.microsoft.com.

![Fork the sample](../assets/contributing/fork-sample.png)

This will make a copy of the site code within your account, this is where you will create the submission.

We recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as your editor.

### Want to practice the setup?

If you feel insecure or would struggle to do this and are new to GitHub, please consider to attend the [Sharing Is Caring sessions from the PnP team](https://pnp.github.io/sharing-is-caring/#pnp-sic-events) in which the Microsoft 365 PnP team provides hands-on guidance for first time contributors -these are NOT recorded and completely safe space to ask questions.
