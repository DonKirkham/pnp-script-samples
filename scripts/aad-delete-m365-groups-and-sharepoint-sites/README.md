# [PnP PowerShell](#tab/pnpps)

```powershell
$AdminCenterURL="https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/"

#Connect to SharePoint admin URL using PnPOnline to use PnP cmdlets to delete M365 groups and SharePoint sites
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $AdminCenterURL -Interactive

#Retrieve all M365 group connected (template "GROUP#0" sites to be deleted) sites beginning with https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/D-Test
$sites = Get-PnPTenantSite -Filter {Url -like https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/D-Test} -Template 'GROUP#0'

#Displaying the sites returned to be deleted
$sites | Format-Table  Url, Template, GroupId

Read-Host -Prompt "Press Enter to start deleting m365 groups and sites (CTRL + C to exit)"

$sites | ForEach-Object {
    #Delete M365 group
    Remove-PnPMicrosoft365Group -Identity $_.GroupId

    #Allow time for M365 group to be deleted
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 60

    #Delete the SharePoint site after the M365 group is deleted
    Remove-PnPTenantSite -Url $_.Url -Force -SkipRecycleBin

    #Permanently remove the M365 group
    Remove-PnPDeletedMicrosoft365Group -Identity $_.GroupId

    #Permanently delete the site and to allow a site to be created with the same URL of the site just deleted, i.e. to avoid message "This site address is available with modification"
    Remove-PnPTenantDeletedSite -Identity $_.Url -Force
}

# Disconnect SharePoint online connection
Disconnect-PnPOnline
```
