# Deploys and Installs SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions to Hub Site and Associated Sites using the tenant app catalog

## Summary

At the time of submitting this script sample there is no concept of a hub site app catalog. However you may want to install or upgrade a SPFx solution to all sites within a hub for example all sites linked to the intranet hub. This sample is applicable for a SPFx solution that needs to be deployed and upgraded across all sites in a hub using the tenant app catalog. There is a similar script [Deploys and Installs SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions to Hub Site and Associated Sites that deploys the app to individual site collection app catalog](../spo-deploy-install-update-spfx-hubsite-associatedsites/README.md)

### Prerequisites

- The user account that runs the script must have Global tenant administrator access. If running the script as SharePoint administrator the cmdlet "Approve-PnPTenantServicePrincipalPermissionRequest" will fail.

- Before running the script, edit the script and update the variable values in the Config Variables section, such as Admin Center URL, Hub Site URL, the CSV output file path and alternatively the sppkg packages Folder.

This script snippet automates the deployment and potential upgrades of SPFx packages across associated sites of a hub site, leveraging the tenant-level app catalog. It navigates through each associated site, checks for existing packages, installs or upgrades them as needed, and records the deployment details for reporting purposes.
