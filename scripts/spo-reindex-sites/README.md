# Re-index SharePoint sites

## Summary

When using SharePoint columns in search solutions, you may need to map crawled properties to managed properties and update the search schema. For example, you can map the crawled property `ows_Foo` to `RefinableString100` and use it as a filter in [KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference). For more information, refer to [How Do Site Columns Become Managed Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/community/how-do-site-columns-become-managed-properties-thus-available-for-search).

If your schema change applies to existing content, you must schedule a re-index operation for the affected content in order to have the data populated into the search index.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scheduling of re-indexing should **ALWAYS** happen at the smallest level possible. If affected data is in a specific library or list, then re-index ONLY the specific library. This can be achieved via the site settings in SharePoint or by using the command [Request-PnPReIndexList](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/Request-PnPReIndexList.html).

> [!CAUTION]
> The below script should **ONLY** be used for the scenario where a schema mapping affects ALL content in your tenant. Site re-indexing may add stress to the search system and take an extended amount of time to complete. Re-crawls of sites with more than one million items can potentially take weeks to process. Subsequent index updates could be delayed until the re-indexing is complete, leading to out-of-date search results. Make sure to only initiate a site re-index after making changes that require all items to be reindexed.

This PnP PowerShell script streamlines the process of re-indexing sites, libraries, or lists to ensure that search results remain accurate and relevant.

$m365Sites = Get-PnPTenantSite -Detailed | Where-Object {($_.Url -like '*/teams-*' -or $_.Template -eq 'TEAMCHANNEL#1') -and $_.Template -ne 'RedirectSite#0' } #filter to exclude redirect sites and to include team channel sites in the list
$m365Sites | ForEach-Object {
    # Connect to SharePoint site

    #Request Reindex
    Request-PnPReIndexWeb
    Write-host "Reindexing: " $_.Url
