# Update list icons & color

## Summary

With a recent change in SharePoint Online, lists now have a icon and a color. However the defaults seem kinda random, this script demonstrates how to change the icons, and the colors, including mapping the current colors and icons to enums to make it easier to work with.

# [PnP PowerShell](#tab/pnpps)

```powershell
function get-customFormatting() {
    Connect-PnPOnline "Site Url"

    Enum Icons {
        Bug = 0
        Calendar = 1
        Target = 2
        Clipboard = 3
        Plane = 4
        Rocket = 5
        ColorPalette = 6
        Lightbulb = 7
        Cube = 8
        Beaker = 9
        Robot = 10
        PiggyBank = 11
        Playlist = 12
        Hospital = 13
        Bank = 14
        MapPin = 15
        CoffeCup = 16
        ShoppingCart = 17
        BirthdayCake = 18
    }

    Enum Color {
        DarkRed = 0
        Red = 1
        Orange = 2
        Green = 3
        DarkGreen = 4
        Teal = 5
        Blue = 6
        NavyBlue = 7
        BluePurple = 8
        DarkBlue = 9
        Lavender = 10
        Pink = 11
    }

    $list = Get-PnPList "ListName";
    $list.Icon = [int][Icons]::Rocket;
    $list.Color = [int][Color]::NavyBlue;
    $list.Update()
    Invoke-PnPQuery

    # Notice!
    # I've also submitted a pull request to PnP PowerShell which would allow you to do all this inline.
    # but as of now that hasn't been accepted, but in the future the below command might work for you
    # Set-PnPList "ListName" -Color NavyBlue -Icon Rocket

```
