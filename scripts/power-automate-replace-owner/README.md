![Example Screenshot](assets/example.png)

## Implementation
Save this script to a PSM1 module file, like `replace-flowOnwers.psm1`. Then import the module file with Import-Module:
```powershell

Import-Module replace-flowOnwers.psm1 -Verbose

```
The -Verbose switch lists the functions that are imported.

Once the module is imported the function `Replace-PnPOwnerInFlows` will be loaded and ready to use.

.SYNOPSIS
Script to replace an owner in all its flows

.Description
this script looks for all flows owned by a specified user and replaces them with a new owner. You can indicate whether this should happen in a certain environment. If no value is given for the environment parameter, the default environment is used. Please note that you cannot remove the original creator of a flow. In that case this script will only add the new owner

.PARAMETER oldOwner
The UPN of the old owner

.PARAMETER newOwner
The UPN of the new owner

.Parameter environment
The name of the environment. The default environment will be used if not provided

.Example 
Replace-PnPOwnerInFlows -oldOwner "john.doe@contoso.com" -newOwner "sansa.stark@contoso.com"
