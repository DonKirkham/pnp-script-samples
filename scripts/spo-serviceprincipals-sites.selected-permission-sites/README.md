# Audit Service Principal Access to SharePoint Sites with Sites.Selected Permissions 

## Summary

Ensuring the security and compliance of your SharePoint environment is crucial, especially when dealing with service principals. These entities often have elevated permissions that, if mismanaged, can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Regularly auditing these permissions is a best practice for maintaining a secure and compliant SharePoint environment.

The Sites.Selected API permission needs to be granted to the service principal.

The Service Principal is granted access to the SharePoint site(s) using the cmdlet:

```PowerShell
grant-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission -AppId 27f0f80f-4c32-4e49-a3ce-377fff559532 -DisplayName  p-m365  -Permissions FullControl
```

The script will scan any permissions granted to service principals across the tenant.

# [PnP PowerShell](#tab/pnpps)

```powershell

    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [string] $domain

$adminSiteURL = "https://$domain-Admin.SharePoint.com"
$TenantURL = "https://$domain.sharepoint.com"
$dateTime = "_{0:MM_dd_yy}_{0:HH_mm_ss}" -f (Get-Date)
$invocation = (Get-Variable MyInvocation).Value

$directorypath = Split-Path $invocation.MyCommand.Path
