## Summary

This sample script may help to identify any custom columns/fields created in SharePoint lists or libraries.

## Implementation

- Open Windows PowerShell ISE
- Create a new file
- Write a script as given below
- Update the `$siteUrl`, `$ReportOutput` and optionally update `$SystemFlds` & `$SystemLists` to remove any values you would like to include in the report

```powershell
# Connect to SharePoint site
$siteUrl = "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/teams/d-app"
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $siteUrl -Interactive

$dateTime = (Get-Date).toString("dd-MM-yyyy")
$invocation = (Get-Variable MyInvocation).Value
$directorypath = Split-Path $invocation.MyCommand.Path
$ReportOutput = "FieldsReports-" + $dateTime + ".csv"

$OutPutFieldsFile = $directorypath + "\Logs\"+ $ReportOutput
