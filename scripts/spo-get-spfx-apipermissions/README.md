# GET API Permissions for SPFx solutions

> This script is part of [SharePoint solutions as a spyware](https://pnp.github.io/blog/post/spfx-solutions-as-spyware/) series, focusing on improving security posture of your tenant.

## Summary

To enhance your tenant's security posture, it's crucial to regularly review the API permissions requested by SPFx solutions and compare them with those granted to the "SharePoint Online Client Extensibility Web Application Principal".

This script analyzes tenant-level and site-level app catalogs and extracts **API Permissions requested by SPFx solutions**. It generates two reports:

-   summary of all **SPFx extensions installed** in SPO sites, including site url, solution name and all **API permissions declared in the manifest**.

    ![API permissions per solution](./assets/APIPermissions.png)

-   summary of API permissions assigned to the "SharePoint Online Client Extensibility Web Application Principal", including **SPFx solutions** that requested them.

    ![Is API permission used](./assets/APIpermissionsUsed.png)

The script also displays a warning if any API permissions are assigned using Application mode. This is unsupported.

> **Important**: The site-level app catalog, from a security perspective, functions like a regular list within a SharePoint Online site. This means that Global or SharePoint administrators do NOT have automatic access. Running the script as an administrator without first granting at least read access to the site would result in INCOMPLETE data.
>
> If the current user does not have access rights to a site hosting site-level app catalog, this script grants them Admin rights for the duration of script execution. The permissions are removed as soon as API Permissions are exported
>
> Site-level app catalog must be enabled by a SharePoint administrator, which gives you a chance to discuss security and governance with the site owner, and ensure you are authorized to perform regular audits of the spfx solutions.

It's important to remember that SPFx solutions may use any API permissions granted to the "SharePoint Online Client Extensibility Web Application Principal" without explicitly requesting them.

## Prerequisites

-   The user running the script must have SharePoint Administrator role in order to access tenant-level app catalog, and to grant themselves (temporary) Owner rights to sites with site-level app catalog
-   The user also requires `Application.Read.All` to read permissions assigned to the SharePoint Online Client Extensibility Web Application Principal.
-   [Pnp.PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/) version 2.5 and PowerShell 7.2 or later
-   [ImportExcel](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel) for exporting results to Excel

# [PnP PowerShell](#tab/pnpps)

```powershell

    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]

# Extract API Permissions requested by SPFx solutions
# Analyzes tenant-level and site-level app catalogs
# Important: site-level app catalog is, in terms of security, a regular SharePoint list within a SPO site. This means that Global/SharePoint
# administrators do NOT have read access.
# To avoid generating partial results, this script temporarily grants current user Site Admin rights (line 112) and removes them after api permissions are exported (line 132)
