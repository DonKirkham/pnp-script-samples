# Add dummy folders and files to a SharePoint library

## Summary

This sample shows how to add dummy folders and files into a SharePoint document library. The script was used to generate files within folders to perform some testing.

## Implementation
 
1. Open Windows PowerShell ISE.
2. Create a new file, e.g. TestDoc.docx and save it to a file server location, e.g. C:/Temp.
3. A loop within another loop using `While` is used to create the number of specified files within each of the specified number of folders. 

# [PnP PowerShell](#tab/pnpps)

```powershell
# Parameters
$SiteURL = "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Company311"

# Library in which to create the dummy files and folders
$LibraryName = "LargeLibrary"

# Location of the dummy file
$LocalFile= "C:\Temp\TestDoc.docx"

# Number of files to create within each folder
$MaxFilesCount = 20

# Number of folders to create in the libraru
$MaxFolderCount = 500

# The name of the folder to be created
$FolderName  = "Folder"

Try {
    # Get the File from file server
    $File = Get-ChildItem $LocalFile

    # Connect to SharePoint online site
    Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SiteURL -Interactive

    # Initialize folder counter
    $FolderCounter = 1
    
    While($FolderCounter -le $MaxFolderCount)
    {
        $newFolderName = $FolderName + "_" + $FolderCounter
        Try {
            # Add new folder in the library
            Add-PnPFolder -Name $newFolderName -Folder "$($LibraryName)" | Out-Null
            Write-Host -f Green "New Folder '$newFolderName' Created ($FolderCounter of $MaxFolderCount)!"   
            
            # Initialize file counter
            $FileCounter = 1

            While($FileCounter -le $MaxFilesCount)
            {
                $NewFileName = $File.BaseName + "_" + $FileCounter + ".docx"
                Try {
                    # Add new file in the folder
                    Add-PnPFile -Path $File -Folder "$($LibraryName)/$newFolderName" -NewFileName $NewFileName | Out-Null
                }
                Catch {
                    Write-Host "Error: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
                }
                Write-Host -f Green "New File '$NewFileName' Created ($FileCounter of $MaxFilesCount)!"
                $FileCounter++
            }
        }
        Catch {
            Write-Host "Error: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
        }
        $FolderCounter++;
   }
}
Catch {
    Write-Host -f Red "Error Uploading File:"$_.Exception.Message
}
```
