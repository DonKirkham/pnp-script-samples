# Sample showing how to extract the employees shown in the People Web part on pages in a selection of Site Collections to CSV

## Summary

One of my customs requested that we removed a specific employee from the People Web part in their Intranet ASAP as that employee had left rather abruptly. They had no idea where that employee was displayed hence this script

## Implementation

- Open VS Code
- Create a new file
- Copy the code below,
- Change the variables to target to your environment
- Run the script.
