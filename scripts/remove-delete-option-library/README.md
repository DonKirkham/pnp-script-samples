# Remove delete option on a document library

## Summary

This sample script will show you how to remove the delete option on a document library to prevent users from accidentally deleting libraries if they have the "edit" permission.
The script will not prevent deletions rather, just disable the UI option.

# [PnP PowerShell](#tab/pnpps)

```powershell

# Display name of SharePoint online list or document library
$libraryName = "My Document Library"

# SharePoint online site URL
$siteUrl = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter your SharePoint site URL (e.g https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/work)"

# Connect to SharePoint online site
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $siteUrl -Interactive

# Remove delete option on a document library
Set-PnPList -Identity $libraryName -AllowDeletion $false

Write-Host "Done! :-)" -ForegroundColor Green

# Disconnect SharePoint online connection
