# Delete inactive Guest User

The script will report inactive users for x days and provides an option to delete them.


## Summary

This PowerShell script identifies and optionally deletes inactive guest users in Microsoft 365. It connects to Microsoft Graph, retrieves guest users, checks their last sign-in date, and lists those who have been inactive for a specified number of days. The script then prompts the user to confirm whether to delete these inactive users.


- Open Windows PowerShell ISE or VS Code
- Copy script below to your clipboard
- Modify the $daysInactive variable as needed.
- Run the script to identify and optionally delete inactive guest users.
